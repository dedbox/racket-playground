# Pixel Playground
**A 2-D multiplayer video game engine for Racket**

This is a growing collection of software fragments I've used to introduce,
explain, and motivate the many facets of video game development for my
after-school group. It doesn't offer much yet. Eventually, it will contain
everything you need to program 2-D multiplayer video games in Racket.

# Install and Run
